# IntelliGrade-H 📝

### AI System for Automatic Evaluation of Handwritten Subjective Answers

An intelligent grading system that reads handwritten student answers, understands them using NLP and large language models, and generates marks with detailed feedback.

Developed for academic research and evaluation workflows at
Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology.

---

# Overview

Evaluating subjective answers is time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. IntelliGrade-H automates this process using modern AI techniques:

• Computer Vision for handwriting recognition
• Natural Language Processing for answer understanding
• Large Language Models for professor-like evaluation
• Hybrid scoring algorithms for fair grading

The system converts handwritten answers into structured feedback and marks in seconds.

---

# Key Features

• Handwritten answer recognition
• AI-based grading using LLMs
• Semantic similarity scoring
• Rubric-aware evaluation
• Detailed student feedback
• Teacher dashboard for batch grading
• API-based architecture for LMS integration

---

# Semantic Similarity

File: `backend/similarity.py`

Uses Sentence-BERT to measure how close a student answer is to the teacher answer.

Features:

• Cosine similarity scoring
• Sentence-level analysis
• Fine-tuning capability

Model used:

all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

---

# LLM Evaluation

File: `backend/llm_evaluator.py`

Uses:

Gemini API

The model evaluates answers like a university professor.

Outputs:

• Marks
• Strengths
• Missing concepts
• Improvement suggestions

Responses are parsed into structured JSON.

---

# Rubric Matching

File: `backend/rubric_matcher.py`

Uses zero-shot classification with DeBERTa NLI.

Benefits:

• No training required
• Detects rubric coverage
• Works for any subject

Example rubric:

Definition
Explanation
Example
Applications.

---

# Evaluation Engine

File: `backend/evaluator.py`

This is the core orchestration module.

Responsibilities:

• Runs the full pipeline
• Aggregates outputs from all models
• Calculates final score
• Generates feedback

Scoring formula

```
Final Score =
0.6 × LLM Score
+
0.4 × Similarity × Max Marks
```

---

# API Layer

# Ethical Considerations

Student identities are anonymized.

Data is processed locally except for LLM requests.

AI grades must be validated by instructors before official use.

---

# Future Improvements

• Diagram recognition
• Mathematical expression grading
• Multilingual support (Tamil / Hindi / English)
• Continuous learning from teacher corrections
• LMS integrations

---

# Research Potential

This project can evolve into:

• An academic publication
• A startup-grade grading platform
• A scalable assessment system for universities
